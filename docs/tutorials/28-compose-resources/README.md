# Tutorial 28: Lock Compose VM resources

`compose.yaml` gives the image two vCPUs and 192 MiB through standard Compose
resource limits. Theseus writes those values into the locked VM plan and
replays the campaign. Use whole vCPU counts and whole MiB memory quantities.

## Before you start

Use a Linux host with KVM and Docker. Run every host command from this
tutorial directory. Choose a published 12-character Theseus release SHA:

```sh
export THESEUS_TAG=<12-character-sha>
export THESEUS_IMAGE=ghcr.io/e6qu/theseus:$THESEUS_TAG
```

The local Dockerfile, Compose or manifest files, and input files below this
directory are the complete tutorial input. No Theseus checkout is used.

## 1. Build the service images

Run these commands on the host:

```sh
name=theseus-compose-resources
mkdir -p api/work
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t "$name-api" api
docker save "$name-api" -o api/work/api.tar
```

Inspect the saved image inputs before continuing:

```sh
find . -path '*/work/*.tar' -type f -print
```

You should see one archive for each service image used by this tutorial.

## 2. Enter the published runtime

Start an interactive shell with this directory mounted as `/tutorial`:

```sh
docker run --rm -it --privileged --platform linux/arm64 \
  -v "$PWD":/tutorial -w /tutorial "$THESEUS_IMAGE" sh
```

The remaining commands in steps 3–5 run inside that shell.

## 3. Prepare the locked runtime inputs

```sh
mkdir -p api/work/runtime api/work/guest
cp /usr/local/bin/firecracker api/work/runtime/firecracker
cp /usr/local/bin/theseus-image api/work/runtime/theseus-image
cp /opt/theseus/vmlinux api/work/guest/vmlinux
```

These copies become inputs to the service manifests. Planning hashes them;
replay does not silently select newer binaries from the container.

## 4. Run, inspect, and replay

```sh
theseus compose explore --output campaign compose.yaml
grep -aF 'THES:SHELL:operation:inspect_cpus:PASS' campaign/services/api/serial.log
theseus compose replay campaign --output rerun
grep -aF 'THES:SHELL:operation:inspect_cpus:PASS' rerun/services/api/serial.log
echo 'PASS: Theseus locked Compose resource limits into the VM'
```

Each `grep` is an observation to review. It exits successfully only when
the recorded bundle contains the behavior named by that command. The replay
command consumes the recorded bundle rather than selecting new artifacts.

## 5. Inspect the retained evidence

```sh
find . \( -path '*/replay-plan.json' -o -path '*/campaign-result.json' \) -type f
find . \( -path '*/result.json' -o -path '*/serial.log' \) -type f
exit
```

Keep `campaign/` and `rerun/` when investigating a result.

## 6. Clean up (optional)

Back on the host, remove generated data only after inspection:

```sh
rm -rf api/work campaign rerun
```
